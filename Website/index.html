        <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve always been fascinated about dragons, there majestical wings and their amazing fire breath. I think this happened because of the how to train a dragon movie. I think I’ve watched it 10 times and every time it was special every time. But since then, I was hooked I bought dragon toys, cuddles and games. But I’ve lost my interest in the last 5 years and I kind of miss being hooked onto something, so I’ve decided to pick up my interest in dragons and really go into depths and learn more about it. To do that I decided to make a website about to share all the information I’ve learned about it and hopefully interest other people in dragons.</p>
